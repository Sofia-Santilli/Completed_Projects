* **Neural Networks**: Reimplementation of the approach proposed by the paper "[_Learning strides in convolutional neural networks_](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.01653.pdf)".
We reimplemented two different pooling layers, used instead of the strides in the convolutional layers and that work in the frequency domain (Fixed spectral pooling and Learnable spectral pooling).
We also substituted the classical Conv2d layers in the network with [_Parametrized Hypercomplex Convolutional layers_](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.04176.pdf), which allow to reduce the overall number of parameters by a factor of N.

* **Deep Learning**: development of architectures that address the Visual Question Answering task. It is a semantic task that aims to answer questions based on an image.
These questions require an understanding of vision, language and commonsense knowledge to answer. The VQA v2.0 dataset, containing open-ended questions about images, has been employed.
